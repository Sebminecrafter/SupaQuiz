# SupaQuiz
⚠️COMMUNITY-MADE 'QUIZZES' ARE THEIR OWN SCRIPTS (and literally aren't even incorporated into supaquiz) AND RUN ON THEIR OWN, RUN THEM AT YOUR OWN RISK⚠️
SupaQuiz is an open-source quiz tool that includes many message-box based quizzes that could contain anything!
<br>
#Longer Description
It is written (at this time) mostly in vbs (Visual Basic Script) and should probably not be used for commercial purposes
None of the included quizzes have any viruses in them :)
But all of the quizzes are written in vbs, so who knows what you guys are going to do?
I don't have the time to make them use anything else, so if you really want to
#Future Plans
I plan to make the quizzes editable and loaded from files (maybe custom engine?) and an editor.
But that probably isn't gonna happen with VBScript
